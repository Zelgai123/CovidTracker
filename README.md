## Introduction
Against the background of the current worldwide covid-19-pandemic, I programmed this tracker to collect and visualize the latest data and news on the subject. The front end was created with the JavaScript Framework React / Redux and the current data on the pandemic is queried by an API (https://disease.sh/).
