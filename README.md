## Introduction
Against the background of the current worldwide covid-19-pandemic, I programmed this tracker to collect and visualize the latest data and news on the subject. The front end was created with the JavaScript Framework React / Redux and the current data on the pandemic is queried by an API (https://disease.sh/).

## Installation
Please execute the following commands in a bash to start the web app in your local development environment.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Zelgai123/CovidTracker.git or just download as .zip
$ cd CovidTracker
$ npm install
$ npm run start
$ open http://localhost:3000/ 
```


## Usage
Worldwide data is displayed by default. This configuration can be changed using the drop-down menu. The data will now be adapted to the selected country.

The world map and especially the circles refer to the covid-cases by default. You can change this by clicking on one of the other two info boxes.

If you click on a country-specific circle on the map, a brief overview of the current Covid situation in this country opens.

The current Covid cases, in each country, are sorted and displayed in a scrollable list.

The diagram shows the temporal course of the worldwide new Covid cases. By hovering over the diagram with the mouse, the specific data can be displayed.
